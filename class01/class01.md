Documentation is THE MOST IMPORTANT thing to do!! If you don't document, if it's not on the Internet, **it does not exist**.

**Shop safety session**. They are MANDATORY, even if you're an expert craftsman, to be able to use the shop (they make notes about who did it!).


### So... Fabrication
Teach how to use the shop, how to exercise the fabrication muscle. Each week you get an assignment, so you have only 7 days to make anything!

Priorities:
1. **SAFETY!!!** Let someone know and ask if you don't know something or if you think something's off.
2. Work hard... well, this is ITP
3. [Documentation](https://itp.nyu.edu/fab/subtraction/documentation/), it has to be uploaded the NIGHT BEFORE the class!! Give credit to your inspirations! Document the process: pre, middle, middle, middle, middle, end (GLAMOUR SHOT üíÖüèº, these are the pictures people click on!) > ULTIMATE MILLENNIAL GOAL, taking pictures of everything ‚ù§Ô∏è


### Tips/Safety
- Buy/gather much more material than you think! Never the exact amount. Things go wrong, plans change, and never lose momentum cause of lack of materials
- Fail fast, fail often (this is kind of the trend in ITP, right?)
- Start early, we only have one week, seven days, As much as Samara has, beat the Ring!
- We have a *Junk shelf*, go for it!
- DO NOT USE GLOVES WHEN WORKING WITH POWER TOOLS! They affect your dexterity and can get caught with the machine
- Getting your materials is half your project


### Assignment
Make a **flashlight**!!
- It's portable
- Creates light

That's about it!
