# Intro to Fabrication - Sept 14


### Doweling Jig, tool of the week
To make centered holes.

### "Times everything by Ï€"
Everything will be more complicated. More expensive, more time, more attempts. Take extras, ALWAYS!

## Repeatability
You'll be making the same thing once or thrice or ten times or more!

> Nobody wants the first pancake

Scalability IS an issue! Doing something five times is no problem... Doing it 1000 times, well...

Always do everything at once, do the operations at the same time. Don't lose the muscle memory.

"You can never have too many clamps"
